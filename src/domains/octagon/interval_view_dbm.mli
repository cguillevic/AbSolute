(** An octagon is a n-dimensional geometrical shape represented by the intersection of n n-dimensional boxes.
    It equips the DBM representation with functions to view elements in the DBM as intervals. *)

(** This module signature provides function to view DBM's values as interval bounds.
    Rational: Conversion of an element in the DBM to an interval depends on the bound type. *)
