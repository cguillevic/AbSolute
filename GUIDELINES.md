# AbSolute's Guidelines

This is a set of reasonable guidelines for formatting AbSolute's file.

# Programming rules
* Indentation: use 2 spaces (__not tabulations__), and respect the 80 columns width limit
* About ML/MLI: each ml file has to come with its mli. TODO public/private
* Comments: use two stars in mli files for the comments that should appear in the doc (as in the following example), one star for the implementation details.
```OCaml
(** Kind of the variable in the abstract domain. *)
  type var_kind 
  ```
